The aim of this module is to introduce students to the new field of bioinformatics (computational biology) and how machine learning techniques can be employed in this area. The course is aimed at students who have no previous knowledge of biology and so the aim of Part 1 of the module is to give a basic introduction to molecular biology as a background for bioinformatics. Part 2 will concentrate on modern bioinformatics applications, particularly those which make good use of pattern recognition and machine learning methods.
